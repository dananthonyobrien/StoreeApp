# Storee App

## Store your stories

For millenia, storytellers have used their eyes, ears, and memory to create their tales. They have always benefited from new technologies - writing, printing, word processing. The Storee App takes advantage of the common features of most mobile devices, such as camera (eyes), voice recorder (ears), data and storage (memory), to enhance writers' ability to craft their stories even while on the move.


Storee stores notes, pictures, voice recordings, and locations for your stories. No more scrambling for pen and paper when the closing line of your chapter hits you on the bus. Just jot down your thoughts or record your voice. No more trying to remember what the sunset looks like even while you are admiring it. Save a picture to your story file for later perusal.
