# Storee App

## Store your stories

For millenia, storytellers have used their eyes, ears, and memory to create their tales. They have always benefited from new technologies - writing, printing, word processing. The Storee App takes advantage of the common features of most mobile devices, such as camera (eyes), voice recorder (ears), data and storage (memory), to enhance writers' ability to craft their stories, even while on the move.


Storee stores notes, pictures, voice recordings, and locations for your stories. No more scrambling for pen and paper when the closing line of your chapter hits you on the bus. Just jot down your thoughts or record your voice. No more trying to remember what the sunset looks like even while you are admiring it. Save a picture to your story file for later perusal.

- Splash screen added to welcome users (in v4)
- Ripple effects added to buttons so that users understand they have been activated and will move to a new screen

## Git
Git tagged releases used. However, as this project was recreated from a later lab for assignment 2, there are two distinct and un-joinable branches (v4 based on older lab and v7 based on later one).

## Personal Statement
There are several significant gaps in this project, including functioning fragments and nav drawer. The Quotation API does work, but a lot more work needs to be done by me to understand how to effectively parse response data, particularly in Android Studio.
